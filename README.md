# Debug View


**Debug View** is a package that allows a low overhead, high performance debug view for your Unity Applications. It is intended to solve the following:

- Give a quick and robust way of displaying debug text on-screen
- It should have low overhead, low memory footprint and allow for easy integration into your projects

## Install


### Through [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html)

Unity's own Package Manager supports [importing packages through a URL to a Git repo](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html):

1. First, on this repository page, click the "Clone or download" button, and copy over this repository's HTTPS URL.  
2. Then click on the + button on the upper-left-hand corner of the Package Manager, select "Add package from git URL..." on the context menu, then paste this repo's URL!

While easy and straightforward, this method has a few major downside: it does not support dependency resolution and package upgrading when a new version is released.  To add support for that, the following method is recommended:
